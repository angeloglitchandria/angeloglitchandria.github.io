        I am a content creator and PhD candidate at IULM University, Milan.

        My current research focuses on the theme of irony in videogames and the way in which game designers can foster the illusion of decentralization for the players.

        I write a newsletter about culture and media, _**Yorick**_.

        I own a YouTube channel about cinema form, _**F For Frame**_.

        I am starting a new project about East Asian Cinema, _**The Grandmasters**_, on YouTube.

        To collaborate, please send me an email.
