        I am a PhD student at IULM University, Milan.

        My current research focuses on the theme of irony in videogames and the way in which videogames foster anti anthopocentric imagination. 

        I write a newsletter about culture and media, _**Yorick**_.

        I edit a YouTube channel about cinema form, _**F For Frame**_.
