abstract: 'This chapter discusses the comic potential that originates in the way players
  of digital games take on the dual position of being at once a played self that is
  internal to the gameworld and a playing self that perceives this world from the
  outside. I first describe the comic attitude as it is defined within philosophy:
  as an attitude of distanced and dispassionate reflection towards an incongruity.
  I then show how the dual position of players during gameplay not only is characterized
  by incongruities, such as contradictions between the apparent seriousness and the
  ultimate triviality of in-game actions, but also allows players to dispassionately
  reflect on these incongruities. I thus argue that digital gameplay entails the inherent
  possibility of turning players into both a comic object and a laughing subject.'
