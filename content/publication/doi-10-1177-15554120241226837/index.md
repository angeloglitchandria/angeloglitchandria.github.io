abstract: ' The application of the Theory of Information to the works of art can show
  why incompleteness and ambiguity offer a more engaging experience to readers and
  users. But when ambiguity becomes a deliberate strategy of the work, it becomes
  difficult to understand how to interpret it: in this article I argue that the correct
  way to interpret a work that makes incompleteness the rule of its poetics is to
  analyze how that strategy is conveyed throughout its basic grammar, without trying
  to solve the puzzles and contradictions that incompleteness and ambiguity inevitably
  produce. This is a relevant issue in the videogame Dark Souls as the basic elements
  of its grammar, level design, gameplay mechanics and narrative, offer the player
  the experience of incompleteness in different ways. In this article, I explain how
  the strategy of incompleteness works in Dark Souls and propose a framework for a
  Zen-wise interpretation of the game mechanics. '
