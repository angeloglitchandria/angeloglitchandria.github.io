abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of abusive game design as an attitude
  towards creating games -- an aesthetic practice that operates as a critique of certain
  conventionalisms in popular game design wisdom. We emphasize that abusive game design
  is, at its core, about spotlighting the dialogic relation between player and designer.
